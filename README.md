# Plant-Disease-Prediction

This is an AI-powered web application that helps detect plant diseases using image classification. Users can upload images of leaves, and the system will predict the type of disease affecting the plant, if any. Itâ€™s built with TensorFlow, Streamlit, and a CNN-based model trained on a dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
